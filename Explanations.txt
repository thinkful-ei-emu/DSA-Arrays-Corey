1) see code

2) "What is the length, capacity and memory address of your array? Explain the result of your program after         adding the new lines of code."
  A) the length of the array reached the _capacity of 3. The push method says that if the capacity is 
      equal to the length of the array then add one to length and * by the SIZE_RATIO which is 3. That
      makes our new capacity 12. They array they gets moved to a new ptr of 3 and the length is allowed to increase to 5.

3)  "What is the length, capacity, and address of your array? Explain the result of your program after adding        the new lines of code."
  A) The length of the array changed by -3. The capcity and ptr stay the same. There is no need for the memory
      position to change if 3 of the array elements are removed in this way.

4) "Print this 1 item that you just added. What is the result? Can you explain your result?"
  A) it prints NaN. The reason for this is the Float64Array only allowing numbers.

   "What is the purpose of the _resize() function in your Array class?"
  A) The _resize() method is used when the capacity of of the array has gone over the current limit.
      this method will increase the capactity via the push method and move the ptr position.
